# burp-pro

Download the Burp Suite Pro (it can be from their official website) and place it in the same folder as the loader.jar

Clearly, this loader is not safe and it is highly recommended to run this on a VM. To run, just execute the command below:

```sh
java -jar loader.jar
```

Install Burp Pro and always run the program through the loader :)
