# burp-pro

Download the Burp Suite Pro (it can be from their official website) and place it in the same folder as the loader.jar! Edit the version as necessary

```sh
https://portswigger-cdn.net/burp/releases/download?product=pro&type=Jar&version=2024.4
```

Clearly, this loader is not safe and it is highly recommended to run this on a VM. To run, just execute the command below:

```sh
java -jar loader.jar
```

Install Burp Pro and always run the program through the loader :)
